mainly slightly variation in weather conditions depend upon on the last seven days

the variation refers to the difference between previous days parameter and present day's parameter 

another dependency is the weather in the current week in consideration and those of previous years 

 dependecy : weather condition of seven previous days and seven upcoming days for previous yFor instance if the weather condition of 16 November 2012 is to be predicted then we will take into consideration the conditions from 09 November 2012 to 15 November 2012 and conditions from 09 November to 22 November 2011 for previous years. Now in order to model the aforesaid dependencies the current year’s variation throughout the week is being matched with those of previous years by making use of sliding window. The best-matched window is selected to make the prediction. The selected window and the current year’s weekly variations are together used to predict the weather condition. The reason for applying sliding window matching is that the weather conditions prevailing in a year may not lie or fall on exactly the same date as they might have existed in previous years. That is why seven previous days and seven ongoing days are being consideredear is taken into consideration


sliding window algo:
we require seven days weather of the current year
fortnight weather conditions for past years

suppose we need to predict weather of 23rd aug 2013 we will take weather conditions of last seven days i.e 16th aug to 22nd aug along with the weather conditions prevaling in the span of 16 th aug to 29 th aug for the past years

then day by day variation in the current year is computed ,the variation is also being computed from the fortnight data of previous year 

parameter requirement:
-: max temp 
-:min temp 
-:humidity 
-:rainfall

matrix represtation:
 for current year is 7x4
for past year is 14x4


firstly we need to divide matrix of 14x 4 into the sliding window
hence we need 8 sliding windows of size 7x4 each
